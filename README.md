## Monitoring

* Cluster services are continously monitored for quality of service (QoS) and billing requirements. This will ensure that the QoS defined by the platform for the clients is within acceptable provisions. Monitoring will also provide inputs (computing and resource usage) for
on-demand service billing.

## Billing

* Includes pricing models and support for different payment options such as the widely adopted mobile money platforms. With application deployment plans defined and based on their different pricing models, integration with payment solutions will be necessary. Most online
payment systems in Africa are now linked with mobile money operations/transactions and the platform support will be crucial.
